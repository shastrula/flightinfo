# Getting Started

#How to install the application

[Windows]
`gradlew.bat clean build bootRun` 

[ Linux/MacOS]
`./gradlew clean build bootRun` 

#How to test UI
Go to `http://localhost:9090`
It will show two links: one for User and the other for Flights

#How to run Restful Service

Use postman:

To retrieve all flights: 
- Set the request to GET 
- Set URL to `http://localhost:9090/flightrest/findAll`

To add/update flight:
- Set the request to POST
- Set URL to `http://localhost:9090/flightrest/update`
- Go to Body and choose raw and MIME type from text to JSON and enter JSON payload, for example

`{
         "id": 1,
         "number": "AF101",
         "flightDate": "10/25/2019",
         "fromAirport": "DFW",
         "toAirport": "HOU"
     }`
- Keep the same flight number if you want to modify existing flight or it will create a new flight

#How to test SOAP Based Web Services

- Use the following URL to test in SOAPUI `http://localhost:9090/ws/flights.wsdl`
- Use SOAPUI to load the following [soapui](soapui/flights-soapui-project.xml) 
- Example [screenshot](soapui/SoapUI-ScreenShot.png)

#How to test RabbitMQ Messages
- Install Rabbit MQ Server using the [installer link](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html)
- Start running rabbitmq server 
- Login to rabbitmq server using URL: http://localhost:15672/#/queues/%2F/flight-queue
    _**User/password: guest/guest**_ 
- You will see the following Queue: [flight queue](rabbitmq/RabbitMQScreenshot.png)
- Use the following URL to post messages in Postman: `
http://localhost:9090/message/post`
- Message example: 
`{
	"message":"Testing",
	"count":1000
}` 
Here message is Testing and Number of messages is 1000.
