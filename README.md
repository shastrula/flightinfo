#How to run Restful Service
[Windows]
`gradlew.bat clean build bootRun` 

[ Linux/MacOS]
`./gradlew clean build bootRun` 

Use postman:

To retrieve all flights: 
- Set the request to GET 
- Set URL to `http://localhost:8080/flights/list`

To add/update flight:
- Set the request to POST
- Set URL to `http://localhost:8080/flights/`
- Go to Body and choose raw and MIME type from text to JSON and enter JSON payload, for example

`{
        "id": 201,
        "number": "A106",
        "flightDate": "20-OCT-2019",
        "fromAirport": "DAL",
        "toAirport": "SAN"
}`
- Keep the same flight number if you want to modify existing flight or it will create a new flight
